🧠 PROJECT GOAL

✅ Build a Frontend (React) + Backend (Node.js) app
✅ Create Docker images for both
✅ Push them to Docker Hub
✅ Deploy both in your kOps Kubernetes Cluster (AWS)
✅ Use a LoadBalancer Service for frontend
✅ (Later) Automate everything with Jenkins pipeline



🚀 Your Goal

You want:

A frontend app 🖥️ (simple UI)

A backend API ⚙️ (handles data)

Both should logically connect — frontend talks to backend

You’ll:

Write Dockerfiles 🐳

Build & push images to a registry (like Docker Hub)

Deploy both apps to your kOps Kubernetes cluster

Create a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins) to automate it

Perfect DevOps workflow! 💪
